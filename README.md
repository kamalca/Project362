# Project362
This project was an iOS app developed for an AMC Hack Sprint competition.

## Premise
The concept of the app, SwipeSwap, was to allow UCLA students to find other students looking to buy or sell dining swipes. The current best solution to the problem is the Facebook page developed for that purpose. However, the Facebook page lacks many crucial features: filtering, sorting, organization, etc. Our app illustrates an approach to remedying these issues.

## Results of competition
The project won "Best Overall Hack".

## Contributions
* David Chen (@dchen8108) was in charge of user experience.
* Wesley Sakutori (@wsakutori) was in charge of backend configuration and graphics.
* Kameron Carr (@kamalca) was in charge of the majority of front end development.
